1.,Weeding,Bradley Method,"The Bradleys used their approach to successfully remove weeds in Ashton Park, part of Sydney Harbor National Park, NSW, from a 16-hectare (40-acre) reserve.","The word ‘bush regeneration ‘currently includes practices other than weed removal, such as replanting and adding species to an environment where soil, water, or fire regimes have transferred the correct type of plant to the region.",Buchanan (1989)            .
2.,Weeding,Computer vision assisted system,The mechanically weeding actuator consists of an integrated servo motor coupled with the computer vision aided system to detect plant sites and direct the weeding actuator to perform mechanical weeding operations without harming crops.,"The accuracy of the system is found to be 93.6% using haar cascade classifier using OpenCV open source framework. Hence, it can be continued using in future.",Nanda and Reddy (2018)
3,Soil moisture detection,Moisture Analyzers and METTLER TOLEDO,Precise temperature control with halogen heating technology and outstanding weighing technology,"Robust construction, built-in performance tests and a comprehensive service offering","(             Hanson et al., 2007            )"
4,Spraying,Telerobotic navigation and target selection,"Targeted selection focuses on the development of a user interface suitable for targeted spraying, while simultaneously telerobotic navigation acknowledges the robot along the rows, so the farmer will be at a safe place away from hazardous materials during the spraying process.","Operator has to guide the robot in any given environment; it may be harsh, mild, etc. Aims to develop further for making it applicable in AgriRobot Project.",George Adamides et al. User Interface Design Principles for Robotics in Agriculture: The Case of Telerobotic Navigation and Target Selection for Spraying
5,Spraying,Filter-paper ratio assured methods for spraying droplets,"In this method, the spraying droplet is measured through filter paper ratio-assumed titration,and works out the corresponding function relationship between the diameter of coloured spots and diameter of liquid drops with regression analysis","Provides simpler way for gathering data, sampling, measuring spraying droplet and research on new type of plant protection machine.",Chen Zhenyu et al. (1996)              Shang et al. (2004)
6,Crop Yield Monitoring Systems,Grain flow sensors for crop yield monitoring,"It includes mass flow and volume flow methods which are located below the pivoted auger under the grain tank and in the middle of the elevator respectively. Mass flow methods use weighing type, impact-type, and radiometric-type units while Volume flow methods include paddle wheel type and optical type units.",Design and fabrication of any particular crop might be affected by the sensing approach which is employed. Signal processing as well correction approaches should be implemented for accurate monitoring,Sun-Ok-             Chung et al. (2016)               Kormann et al. (1998)
