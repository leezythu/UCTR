Testing protocol,Parameters,Justification
1                  . Establish contact for compression/obtain reference length for uniaxial tension,"10 g load at 0.005 mm/s.            Filtered at 20 Hz using a low pass, third order Butterworth filter during the test.",Load is low enough so as to not strain the tissue out of the toe region. Filter was used to remove noise due to machine vibrations.
2                  . Ramp load - unload,15% strain at 20%/s strain rate followed by immediate unload at the same rate (starting 300 μm offset from contact).,To obtain tissue response before preconditioning.
3                  . Preconditioning,1000 cycles between 10 and 15% strain at 2 Hz (starting 300 μm offset from contact).,"Cheng et al. (             Cheng et al., 2009            ) suggests soft tissues should be preconditioned to the maximum strain used in the study, experiential learning from pilot tests (number of cycles gave repeatable results in pilot tests and 10–15% strain avoided sample dislodging during unconfined compression test)"
4                  . Ramp load - unload,15% strain at 20%/s strain rate followed by immediate unload at the same rate (starting 300 μm offset from contact).,To obtain tissue response after preconditioning.
5                  . Establish contact for compression/obtain reference length for uniaxial tension,"10 g load at 0.005 mm/s.            Filtered at 20 Hz using a low pass, third order Butterworth filter during the test.",Load is low enough so as to not strain the tissue out of the toe region. Filter was used to remove noise due to machine vibrations.
6                  . Multi-step stress-relaxation,Ramp to 5-10-15% target strains at 20%/s strain rate and a 30 min wait/hold (starting 300 μm offset from contact).,"Multi-step test allows examination of a non-linear relaxation model at different strain levels. The strain and strain rates (while trying to reach as high as possible) were decided upon after pilot repeatability tests, assessing limits of testing system to apply them with accuracy and to stay within the non-destructive load ranges."
