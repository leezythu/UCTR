Level of uncertainty,Shared typology (PA and PM) for dealing with uncertainty in decisionmaking/policymaking,Shared typology (PA and FF)            for improving insight into future developments and dealing with future uncertainty
Level 1            :            Clear enough future.,Optimal policy            :            Forecast the expected future and choose an ‘optimal’ policy for that future.,"Forecasting:             Single reliable forecast based on trend extrapolation and expert judgement, in combination with a sensitivity analysis."
Level 2            :            Alternative futures (with probabilities).,Risk-based policy            :            Use probabilities to optimize policy in accordance with the risk attitude of the policymaker.,"Probabilistic forecast:             Probabilistic forecasts, for which the likelihood of all relevant parameters can be expressed in terms of probabilities."
"Level 3            :            A limited, bounded set of plausible futures.",Static robust policy            :            Identify plausible futures and find a policy that works acceptably across most of them.,"Foresight            :            Limited range of scenarios that is intended to explore the envelope of plausible future developments, based on an ever increasing understanding of the system and its key uncertainties."
"Level 4            :            An unlimited, unbounded set of possible futures.",Adaptive policy            :            Adapt the policy over time as conditions change and learning takes place.,"Futures            :            Use large numbers of possible scenarios that are intended to explore what might happen, given our lack of understanding of the future."
