Marks Instantiation and Customization,"W: Predefined marks only, referred to as chart type H: Start with default, click chart in outline view to change. Must choose data grouping before seeing marks."
Glyph Composition,"H: Combine predefined marks into glyphs as layers. Such layers can be nested within existing charts, enabling a wide range of combinations and mappings."
Path Points and Path Segments,"W: Map x and y to data dimensions. H: Drag data dimension or aggregate to the x or y VC-channel of the chart, if the chart type is                         line, area                        or                         stream                        ."
Links between Glyphs,"W: Limited availability. H: For example, a line chart can be layered under a plot, with identical x/y data mappings linking the glyphs. However, for future work we aim to introduce a linking tool similar to that of Charticulator"
Data Scoping for Glyphs,"W: Custom dimensions and groupings:                         all, identity, monolith                        , sparse and non-sparse grouping modes. H: An                         all                        dimension to create one mark per tuple, a                         identity                        dimension to create a single mark representing the data selection of the parent node (if root, the entire dataset). Grouping by a dimension implicitly aggregates the data by that dimension. Groupings by a dimension are by default sparse, i.e they will not show empty marks when nesting. If non-sparse, empty data is created to populate each nested viewport. To create one glyph per dimension, use the                         Monolith                        grouping of a numeric dimension."
Mapping Data Values to Visual Properties,"H: Drag dimension or aggregate from data view and drop on channel, or select from menu. Available mappings depend on the data scope of the selected chart."
Scales,"W: Scales for categorical, temporal, and numerical data H: Implicitly created when mapping data to channels (visual properties)"
Axes and Legends,"H: Created when a data binding is applied. Hidden by default if chart is nested, except for color mappings. Each legend/axis is customized with channels, the same way a chart is customized."
Relative Layout,H: Use the                         Bounds                        channel to free-form position a chart in normalized space.
Layout in a Collection,"H: Marks are always positioned according to the layout of the selected chart type. Each chart has a set of visual channels, and in most cases a set of                         layout                        channels, some mappable to data (for example the x and y position of a line chart)."
Nested Layout,"H: If the chart is nestable (appropriate data and chart type), another chart may be nested within it. Since separate aspects of layouts can be mapped to any eligible data dimension or aggregate, this implicitly changes the space in which the nesting is done. With the                         bounds                        channel we can edit the bounds of a chart in a normalized space. If the parent space is deformed (i.e an arc) the geometry of the child chart is deformed accordingly (for example, a square to an arc)."
Coordinate Systems,"W: Cartesian, Polar, extensible to others. H: Each chart is seen as a set of 2D shapes, these shapes are simply transformed to fit within the given parent shape. As such, an arc can deform a rectangle to fit within itself. Each chart type must specify                         how                        it is to be deformed."
