MRI parameter,Description
Surface to curve ratio (S/C),"Indicates the plate (surface) to rod (curve) ratio of the trabeculae. A higher ratio is a marker of greater trabecular network integrity (             Rajapakse et al., 2014            )."
Erosion index (EI),"Represents topological parameters expected to increase             versus            those expected to decrease, with erosion cause by osteoclastic resorption. A higher index is consistent with greater trabecular deterioration (             Rajapakse et al., 2014            )."
Bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) (%),Represents the ratio of bone volume to total volume in the region of interest.
Trabecular thickness (TbTh) (mm),Represents mean thickness of trabeculae
Trabecular number (TbN) (1/mm),Represents mean number of trabecular per unit length
Trabecular separation (TbS) (mm),Represents the bone marrow space between trabeculae
Cortical thickness (CTh) (mm),Represents mean cortical bone thickness
Elastic modulus (GPa),Main component of FEA and a marker of bone mechanical competence
