Method,Relation to LC-NE system,Advantages,Limitations
Pharmacological challenge (e.g. atomoxetine),Changes in synaptic concentrations of NE mimic the effects of elevated/ reduced NE release by LC.,Allows within-subject comparison of behavior and physiology (i.e. normal vs. elevated NE levels).,Pharmacological agents are rarely specific of one neuromodulatory system and likely interact with other systems; each individual may have different responsivity; invasive.
PET,NE transporter availability reflects functionality of LC projections.,Allows for direct molecular quantification.,Very low temporal resolution; invasive.
Pupillometry,Non-reflexive pupil dilation accompanies LC phasic activation and tracks changes in tonic LC firing.,Relatively high temporal resolution to study task-evoked LC activity with low budget; non-invasive.,Constitutes an indirect measurement of LC activity; other neuromodulators may contribute to changes in pupil size.
Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI,"LC is rich in neuromelanin, a molecule that is paramagnetic and can be detected through MRI.",Allows the highest precision in LC localization in humans in vivo; non-invasive.,Does not provide information about LC function; intensity in LC may vary with age.
fMRI,Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) changes in LC reflect the level of neuronal activation in the nuclei.,Allows measuring task-related and resting state changes of activity with relatively high spatial resolution; non-invasive.,"Many sources of artifacts affect the quality of the measurements, i.e. head movement and confounds from cerebro-spinal fluid vicinity; the small size of LC may also provide a low signal-to-noise ratio; requires specific brainstem co-registration steps."
ERP (P300),P3 indexes phasic LC response.,Allows high temporal resolution of a relatively well characterized component; non-invasive.,LC contributes only in part to the component.
