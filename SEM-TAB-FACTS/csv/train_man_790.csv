Characteristics,Pre-condition,Risk
"Single instead of multiple drug product delivered to the patient, increasing compliance while reducing medical error",Proven synergistic medical benefit and safety from combinational clinical trials,Possible reduction in dosage flexibility            Number of patients that can accept combination therapy could show population and disease variance
Simplified CMC and logistics,Integration in process development            Stability of each DC does not change significantly in the mixture            Analytics to characterise the degradation of individual drug component in the mixture,More complex control strategy            Availability of analytics            Change in delivery route if co-formulated products have lower concentration tolerance (             e.g.            from SC to IV)            Additional clinical trials are needed to prove the safety of co-formulated products
New market/product differential strategy,Potential IP extension of existing drugs,New regulation landscape needs to be introduced (potential delay in BLA approval)
