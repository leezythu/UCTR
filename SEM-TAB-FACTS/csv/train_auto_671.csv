RQ1,Did participants learn facts about wastewater management during the proposed online survey to elicit swing weights?,Factual learning occurs if the final knowledge score is higher than the initial knowledge score.,Swing survey (                         N                        = 298)
RQ2,Did participants follow the process instructions of the online survey to elicit swing weights?,Process compliance occurs if participants correctly followed the three instructions of the process.,Swing survey (                         N                        = 298)
RQ3,Did participants learn about their preferences during the online survey to elicit swing weights?,Preference learning occurs if the three self-reported answers indicated that this was the case.,Swing survey (                         N                        = 298)
RQ4,Did the participants who did not comply with the process to elicit swing weights perform a direct rating of objectives?,Participants were considered to have performed a direct rating if (1) the weight distribution statistically significantly differed from the one of swing and (2) if there was no statistically significant difference with direct rating.,1. Sub-sample “invalid swing” of the swing survey (                         N                        = 262)                        2. Sub-sample “swing” of the swing survey (                         N                        = 36)                        3. Direct rating survey (                         N                        = 357)
