1. Symptoms of myocardial ischemia","COVADIS criteria for microvascular angina
•                              Effort and/or rest angina                                •                              Angina equivalents (i.e. shortness of breath)"
2. Absence of obstructive CAD (>50% diameter reduction and/or FFR <0.80) by either:,•                              CT coronary angiography (CTCA)                                •                              Invasive coronary angiography
3. Objective evidence of myocardial ischemia,•                              Ischemic ECG changes during an episode of chest pain                                •                              Stress-induced chest pain and/or ischemic ECG changes in the presence of transient/reversible abnormal myocardial perfusion and/or wall motion abnormality
4. Evidence of impaired coronary microvascular function,"•                              Impaired coronary flow reserve (cut-off values depending on methodology use between ≤2.0 and                              ≤                              2.5)                                •                              Coronary microvascular spasm, defined as reproduction of symptoms, ischemic ECG shifts but no epicardial spasm during acetylcholine testing.                                •                              Abnormal coronary microvascular resistance indices (e.g. IMR >25, HMR ≥2.5                              mm Hg·cm-1·s) (69)                                •                              Coronary slow flow phenomenon"
