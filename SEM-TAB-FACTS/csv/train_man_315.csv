Term,Explanation
Chart,A chart has a type and associated tabular input data that is represented by output marks.
Chart type,"A type of chart within the Visception framework, consists of its own layout that is controlled by some of its VC-channels. The layout controls the shape and position of the chart’s output marks."
Output marks,Graphical marks of a single chart.
VC-channel,Controls a particular aspect of the appearance or layout of a chart.
VC-channel mapping,The assignment of data (for example a dimension) to a VC-channel (for example             fill color            ).
Layout space,Normalized space in which a layout is initially computed.
Parent space,"Space(s) in which a chart’s output marks are embedded according to the computed layout. If the node is a root node, the parent space is simply the root viewport. Otherwise, a chart-dependent region within the output marks of the parent chart."
Data object,"Represents a selection from a tabular dataset. May be one of the following: 1) A single row, 2) A list of rows, 3) A list of values."
Chart input data,"A set of data objects inherited from the parent VC-node. If the node is the root VC-node, the input data is the list of rows of the entire dataset."
Chart mapping,Transforms every input data object into a new set of data objects.
Chart output data,"A set of data objects, used for rendering the chart, and possibly as input data to child charts."
