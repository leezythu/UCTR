Method,Study descriptions
Eco-efficiency composite indicators,"-                  Used an indicator (vitamin C-content / CO                   2                  emissions) to estimate the impact of elevated CO                   2                  treatment in greenhouses on the nutrient-content of spinach and compared this to conventional growing methods (                   Seo et al., 2017                  ).                    -                  Calculated the Nutrition Carbon Footprint Score [Nutrition Balance Concept (i.e., a nutrient index) / carbon footprint] to assess the feasibility of reformulating grain products by incorporating yellow pea flour (                   Chaudhary et al., 2018b                  )."
Scoring composite indicators,"-                  Scored how changes in farm management affect sustainability, using 19 diverse metrics related to animal welfare, nutrient-contents, the environment, economics, and food safety (                   Zucali et al., 2016                  ).                    -                  Assessed the sustainability of canteen meals by developing a scoring system based on nutritional requirements, environmental impacts, as well as management and production practices (                   Schaubroeck et al., 2018                  ).                    -                  Compared the sustainability of omnivore and vegan/vegetarian diets differentiated by organic and non-organic production systems on a health and environmental basis (                   Baroni et al., 2007                  ).                    -                  Compared food items on the basis of IPCC generated GHG emission values per kg protein, nutrient density, GJ, and ton of product (                   Doran-Browne et al., 2015                  ).                    -                  Developed the Nutritional Footprint, which scores foods based on environmental and nutritional parameters (                   Speck et al., 2013                  )."
Classification composite indicators,"-                  Classified food items into three sustainability groups based on GHG emissions and the nutrient quantities of six nutrients (                   van Dooren et al., 2017                  )."
Scaled composite indicators,"-                  Developed a sustainability index by converting different metrics to a common scale (i.e., 0–10) (                   Müller-Lindenlauf et al., 2010                  ). They evaluated organic farms differentiated by grassland percentage and feed intensity. They included environmental, animal welfare, and milk nutrition (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, conjugated linoleic acids, and antioxidants) metrics."
System-based models,"-                  Modeled the food system with a systems dynamic (SD) model (                   Sabaté et al., 2016                  ) by including drivers of nutrient-contents, health outcomes, and environmental degradation, in addition to more social concerns such as food sovereignty and governance.                    -                  Explored the environmental and socioeconomic changes of food systems, with a SD model, impacted by resilience factors, with food and nutrition security as outcomes (                   Allen and Prosperi, 2016                  ).                    -                  Linked the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), which is a partial equilibrium model to a comparative risk framework to understand the risk to health based on changes in agricultural production (                   Springmann et al., 2016b                  ).                    -                  Used IMPACT with nutritional analyses (calculated via nutrient indices) to evaluate changes in nutrient availability based on future climate scenarios (                   Beach et al., 2019                  ;                   Nelson et al., 2018                  )."
Optimization algorithms,"-                  Used a linear programming model to simulate the Swiss food supply, comprised of agricultural production, food processing, external trade, and food stock management components and linked it to environmental indicators and nutritional requirements to optimize the food supply (                   von Ow et al., 2020                  )."
Nutritional-LCA,"-                  Measured the nutrient quantity of antioxidants in cauliflower, based on varying levels of mineral fertilizer added to compost, for the functional unit (FU) (                   Martínez-Blanco et al., 2011                  ).                    -                  Estimated omega-3 contents in livestock systems (e.g., beef-concentrate vs beef-forage, chicken-intensive vs. chicken-extensive) to be used as FUs (                   McAuliffe et al., 2018                  ).                    -                  Developed the Combined Nutritional and Environmental-LCA framework, which uses epidemiological studies to compare the dietary risks (e.g., stroke, colorectal cancer) and environmentally-driven health impacts (e.g., asthma from particulate matter emissions) of food items like milk (                   Stylianou et al., 2016                  ).                    -                  Compared pork items produced under different production scenarios (e.g., organic vs. conventional), while using different FU (e.g., protein) (                   Teixeira et al., 2013                  ).                    -                  Defined nutrient equivalent units (NE) as the FU, to compare vegetables in a multi-cropping system. NE was defined as the mean of the ratios between the nutrients present in a food to the DRI (                   Li et al., 2018                  )."
