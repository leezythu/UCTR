Research perspective,Status
Actors,"Much research is conducted with adolescents in mind, and to a limited extent, children. Research with adults and elderly are vastly missing. Extant research seems to suggest that users who are young, female, and highly educated are more prone for PSU, but the results are inconclusive."
Use setting,"Research is most often conducted without a specific setting in mind, and to some extent, in academic settings. Differences explained by different work settings and culture are vastly missing."
Factors explaining use and PSU,"A multitude of factors are investigated to explain both use and PSU. There is considerable uncertainty as to whether a factor is explaining use or PSU. E.g., whereas FOMO may explain use, a lack of self-control may explain why this use becomes problematic."
Smartphone use,"Recently, research has focused more on the type of smartphone use rather than considering problematic use as a result of the phone itself. Whereas social media and texting seem to be most problematic for females, gaming seems to be more problematic for males."
PSU,"PSU is defined in different ways and needs clarity. There is no general agreement on what normative smartphone use is (e.g., by using cut-off values in measurement instruments), and for which user groups (e.g., it is most likely more acceptable with extensive use for a CEO than a student) and for which type of use (e.g., it is most likely more acceptable with extensive calling than extensive gaming)."
PSU consequences,"Research suggests that emotional health issues are the most prominent consequence of PSU. However, these issues have also explained use and PSU, and there is a need to define and determine how central factors and concepts are related."
Evaluation of use,"Whereas many studies suggest measures to avoid PSU, little research is conducted to test working measures."
Theoretical frameworks,"Whereas several theoretical frameworks have been adopted, they are often related to identifying factors explaining use and problematic use and more seldom to analyze findings. Also, there was frequently no specific theoretical lens employed."
Methodological approaches,"A vast majority of the studies use a quantitative survey to study PSU. The results of the hypotheses testing are often not easily identifiable, and the research model is not always presented."
