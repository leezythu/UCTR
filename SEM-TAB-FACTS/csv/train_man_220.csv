"Some people are shifting towards the supermarket, because they have no time to go to the market in the morning. But when they come back from work there is no market anymore, but supermarkets are still open.            (ID206_R2)","I buy all vegetables at the market. It is convenient, for example: on my way to work I go to the vendor and ask her to clean and cut the vegetables. Then the vender will wrap it in a plastic bag and give it to my mom later … The vegetables can also be delivered to my home. I am happy with this.            (ID97_R1)"
"When I get older and can't do the shopping for my daughter anymore, I expect my family to move to shop in the supermarket. The supermarket is convenient: it is just across the street and offers a lot of different and interesting things.            (ID97_R2)","I don't buy vegetables at the supermarket, since the supermarket has only limited choice. The market has much more choice and I can buy small quantities.

"In the subsidy period it was terrible we even lacked basic foods like rice and other foods. Now life is much easier. I like to buy house stuff. The market looks ugly, in the sense that the country is not developed. But it is not sure that the development of supermarkets can guarantee our safety. But when there are no markets of course we need to go to supermarkets.            (ID362_R2)","Because of my office hours I go shopping before 8am. Where to shop is also affected by, for instance, my work. My lifestyle makes that I shop at the market for convenience. If the government removes the market, than it will impact my life a lot, since shopping at supermarkets is much more time consuming, instead of just passing by and quickly buying, I have to park, enter, walk around, buy, wait for the payment, …            (ID390-R1)"
,"Supermarket shopping is complicated. It is very time consuming. I have to queue for payment, while I don't know how safe it is.            (ID102_R1)"
