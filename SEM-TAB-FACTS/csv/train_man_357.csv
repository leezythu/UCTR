Key Ventilation Specifications,E-Vent Recommendations,RepRapable OS Design
2.1. Control of Breathing Rate (breaths per minute),8–30 BPM,"5–45 BPM, controlled by user interface"
2.2 Control of Tidal Volume (air volume pushed into lung in mL),200–800 mL based on patient weight,"100–846 mL, controlled by user interface"
2.3 Control of I/E Ratio (inspiratory/expiration time ratio),best if adjustable between range of 1:1–1:4,"Adjustable between range of 1:1–1:4, controlled by user interface"
"2.4 Assist detection pressure. When a patient tries to inspire, they can cause a dip on the order of 1–5 cm H             2            O, with respect to PEEP pressure (not necessarily = atmospheric).",Required,Can be added based on pressure             [132]            or temperature             [66]            feedback
3. Airway pressure must be monitored,Required,"Contains two pressure sensors connected between the ventilator and patient via an airway tube, pressures are shown on the LCD screen"
3.1.1 Pressure limits: Max pressure,40 cm H             2            O,Alarms sound if pressure exceeds 40 cmH             2            O
3.1.2 Pressure limits: Plateau pressure,30 cm H             2            O,Can be added by introducing a pause at the end of the inspiratory phase             [132]
3.2 Passive mechanical blow-off valve,40 cm H             2            O,Can be purchased together with the self-inflating bag kit
3.3.1 Monitor plateau pressure,Clinician viewable,Can be added by modifying the control algorithm
3.3.2 Monitor PEEP,Clinician viewable,"Can be added, need software to see the quantitative value"
3.4 PEEP,5–15 cm H             2            O,2–11 cm H             2            O based on observed data during testing
4. Manual clinician override,Failure of automatic ventilation allows conversion to immediate ventilation.,Yes
5. Ability to use ventilation on room air.            Implemented with an oxygen/air gas blender that some hospitals already have.,Required for emergencies,Yes
6. HEPA filtration on the patient’s exhalation,Required because COVID-19 can be aerosolized,"Can be added, HEPA filters can usually be purchased alongside manual resuscitator bags."
8. Failure conditions result in alarm,Required,Alarms sound if pressure exceeds the allowed limits from 5 to 40 cmH             2            O
