Terms,Descriptions
Inoculum,The organic material containing bacteria used for setting up anaerobic digestion environment.
Substrates,The organic materials used as raw-materials for anaerobic digestion.
Total solids,The total solid component of the substrates and inoculum left after drying.
Volatile solids,The total organic component of the dried substrates and inoculum lost after combustion.
Ash,The inorganic component of the total solids left after combustion.
S:I ratio,The weight ratio between substrate and inoculum.
Anaerobic digestion,The biological degradation of organic substrates at temperature regime suitable to anaerobic microbes' metabolic reactions.
Biogas,The gas produced after series of complex biochemical reactions during anaerobic degradation of substrates.
Cumulative biogas yield,The accumulated total of daily volumetric biogas yield.
Specific biogas yield,The daily volumetric biogas yield per unit mass of total solids or volatile solids.
