Anaerobic Digestion,"•                  AD is a flexible technology for nutrient and organic waste management and, to a lesser extent, energy generation.                    •                  AD is a popular community investment. Plants of varying sizes provide communities with bespoke resource management solutions. Digestate, bio-gas and biofuels are used locally.                    •                  Large commercial plants are uncommon, unless they offer community share schemes.                    •                  Decisions on planning, siting and dispute resolution are mediated within community interest groups.","•                  Growth in UK farming increases fertiliser demand. With high fuel costs, this makes AD is a valuable source of biomaterials.                    •                  AD sees rapid innovation to enhance the quality of non-energy outputs.                    •                  Small scale AD is common in both rural and urban areas. Households and businesses use AD to turn inedible food waste into growing material and bio-gas.                    •                  Large scale AD is used to process inedible wastes from the agri-food system to produce biomaterials, fuel, chemicals, digestate and gas.","•                  AD is                   the                  route for disposing of inedible organic wastes.                    •                  Large indoor farms have built-in AD and/or bio-refineries to produce energy, biomaterials, chemicals and pharmaceuticals from hybridised feedstocks.                    •                  Public services (e.g. hospitals) also have digesters on-site.                    •                  The delivery of digestate to soils is optimised using regulatory mechanisms and automated technologies to maximise benefit.                    •                  AD is not typically used to produce electricity but to supply gas to grid."
Insect Proteins,"•                  Insect farms provide a local source of protein and their production makes use of organic wastes and heat from local industry (including AD).                    •                  Insects are another option in the ‘grow your own’ market. Alongside fruit and veg, insect farms are commonly found in allotments and in community gardens. These insects are either eaten by growers or used as feed for their chickens.                    •                  Community owned insect farms are common with people buying into larger, more efficient production processes.","•                  Insects are extensively used as animal feed and beginning to feature in food market. In some locations wild catch supplements farmed stock.                    •                  Food courts provide outlets to experiment with food, including new insect products for personal consumption.                    •                  Household insect farms are common; entrepreneurs have designed ‘coffee-pod-style’ starter kits to increase accessibility.                    •                  Large-scale insect farming is used to produce animal feed, reducing UK’s reliance on overseas imports.","•                  Small numbers of large businesses dominate the insect market. These are new entrants (at least to the protein market) with heavily automated production lines and high levels of technological sophistication.                    •                  Production is localised, but standardised with verified breeds, breeding systems and trade practices ensuring acceptable standards.                    •                  Insects are used as feed for livestock and pets, or as an enriching agent in products for people, reducing the volume of meat proteins in the market."
Redistribution of surplus food,"•                  Edible food waste is reduced by produce and meal sharing schemes via apps, supper clubs and community fridges. These low-tech solutions help to improve social cohesion.                    •                  New small-medium businesses and community enterprises emerge, producing secondary food products from food surplus and edible waste reclaimed from the supply chain.                    •                  Restaurants and eateries vary their menus, working closely with suppliers to accommodate produce when it is available.","•                  The volume of edible food waste reduces as food scarcity becomes more evident, food prices rise and tolerance to unattractive produce increases.                    •                  A resurgence of traditional skills (e.g. bottling and canning) allows people to prolong the life of produce, manage gluts and use damaged produce.                    •                  A higher incidence of dining-out makes edible wastes easier to use and inedible wastes easier to collect.                    •                  Inedible wastes are valuable and composted or used for AD.","•                  Overproduction is lessened by smart stock management, allowing retailers to manage gaps and gluts, and farmers to adapt to demand.                    •                  Smart packaging senses food deterioration, reducing waste in shops and homes.                    •                  The rise in convenience food increases end-of night surplus; eateries now commonly offer cheap or free food at closing time. Several apps serve to locate and advertise surplus foods.                    •                  Inedible wastes are disposed of directly to a centralised organic waste management system (e.g. via macerators)."
