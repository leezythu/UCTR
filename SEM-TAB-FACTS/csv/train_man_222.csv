"If the state will remove this informal street market it will affect us a lot, while in return the market doesn't affect them at all. People just start selling in their house or rent other's ground floor, to evade selling on the streets. Besides, the government started building markets in places where people don't want/need a market; (example)why spending a lot of money for building markets without customers?            (ID258_R2)","I am a teacher, and I have some colleagues with relatives in the countryside. Once a week, the relatives send vegetables to the school to be sold to all of us. Some people from the coastal areas send shrimps, crabs, squid and sea fish. The mother of my friend lives in Hai Phong [coastal city]. When she visits her mother, she will buy mackerel and other sea fish to sell it here. If these families sell something, we can trust it.            (ID99_R1)"
"This street market should not be removed from our neighbourhood. The vendors are familiar people to us, who have been selling here for a long period. The older they are, the harder it is to find a job. How will they live without selling in this market?            (ID362_R1)",Now there is the trend that people want to eat safe vegetables. They started selling safe vegetables at offices for all the employees. (ID206_R2)
"If the government wants to close the markets, of course it will affect the livelihoods of the people around here, especially the vendors in the market, like my mother, will suffer. The families will have a hard time when they can't continue their business.            (ID250_R1)","I get chicken from my colleague. Each time when she goes to her hometown, she brings it for me. At my academy there is an online market, so called ‘countryside market of the Academy’, Many teachers sell their homemade foods there. I trust these foods, because they are all my colleagues so it must be credible. I more believe in the source of acquaintances.            (ID390_R1)"
I go to the market every day. I like to go shopping there. … I am familiar with the vendors.            (ID28_R1),"When I visit my parents [in the countryside] I buy food and send it by bus to Hanoi. In the past my mom bought foods for me and my father would send it via bus for me to Hanoi. This was really convenient, because the driver would call me for receiving the goods. But my dad had a stroke last year and now my mom is too busy, so I don't ask her anymore.            (ID315_R1)"
"It is necessary to create conditions for rural producers to do business and for elderly people to afford good food. For instance, retired people buy a bunch of vegetables at the market for 5000VND. But when they have to go to the supermarket and maybe pay double, how can they afford that? We have to take care of these people (vendors and buyers) that depend on the market.            (ID99_R1)","Sometimes I buy online, via Facebook I joined a community of farmers. You learn and see many people on Facebook who cultivate organically or half organically. I also try to believe them, because many of the members are really passionate about organic farming. I often eat fish and I mostly buy fish via Facebook, because it is difficult to buy fresh and safe seafood nowadays. I buy fish mostly from people on the internet. They are from the coastal, fishing areas.            (ID127_R1)"
