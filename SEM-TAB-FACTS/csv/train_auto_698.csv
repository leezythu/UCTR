Defect code,Represented weld defect,Intentionally-embedded tungsten procedure
D1,Vertical blind hole (representing a vertical crack),Drilling a ø3 mm hole (depth: 9.5 mm)                        Using a ø3 mm tungsten ball on top of the hole to block the melt filling it
G1,Controllable-size and controllable-shape lack of fusion,Machining a slot (deepest section: 5.3 mm depth)                        Using a ø2.4 mm tungsten rod on top of the slot to avoid the melt flowing inside the slot
G2,Inclusion,No machining or grinding                        Dividing the 280 mm weld length to two 125 mm length welds to leave 30 mm blank space in the weld length centre                        Putting a 30 mm length tungsten rod (ø2.4 mm) surrounded by some amount of iron powder
G3,Crack,Grinding two oriented narrow slot using a 1 mm thick Dremel cutting disk                        Using a ø1 mm tungsten rod on top of each slot to avoid the melt flowing inside the slot
G4,Oriented lack of fusion (controllable size and shape),No machining or grinding                        Dividing the 280 mm weld length to two 125 mm length welds to leave 30 mm blank space in the weld length centre                        Putting a 30 mm length tungsten pipe (OD: ø3 mm; ID: ø2 mm) in an oriented way (30-degree in comparison with the weld line)
G5,Sidewall lack of fusion (controllable size and shape),Machining a slot (deepest section: 3 mm depth) in the side of the weld                        Putting a 30 mm length tungsten pipe (OD: ø3 mm; ID: ø2 mm) surrounded by some amount of iron powder
