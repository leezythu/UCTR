"I worked for a supermarket, so I know that the supermarket is also unsecure. … I have to buy foods that I feel confident about … Nutrition is important, but for me safety is most important …. First safety, second nutrition, then taste and mood. … I even go to the slaughterhouse to see how they cut the meat on a table, not on a dirty floor, then I think it is more trustworthy.            (ID 97_R1)","When we eat vegetables in the evening, we buy them that day fresh … I change food frequently for the diversity of substances and flavours. I buy fish when it is still swimming, meat from vendors that are quickly sold-out, vegetables from people who bring their veggies directly from the countryside.            (ID250_R1)"
"If supermarkets would be a safer source than I would consider shopping there, it's not only about convenience, but I don't believe it. TV and newspapers reported many cases of supermarkets relabelling expired products, or pig meat from pigs that were injected with sleeping pills. Besides, supermarkets and market vendors buy from the same wholesalers.            (ID99_R1)","If you cook one time for several meals, you are more likely to get cancer … I met a doctor, who got cancer. She told me that she got cancer because she used to prepare food days in advance since she didn't have time to cook daily. To avoid cancer, we do not eat left-over food and eat every day fresh foods.            (ID206_R1)"
"I don't want to buy vegetables at the supermarket. Previously, I bought foods from the supermarket, but then I saw some sellers from the market bringing their products to the supermarket. I stopped shopping at the supermarket, I lost faith.            (ID102_R1)","All these foods will be eaten today evening and maybe tomorrow morning. If anything is leftover until tomorrow afternoon, then I will give it to the garbage collector.            (ID258_R1)"
"Recently it was in the news that supermarkets erased all the dates on expired products and relabelled them. Also, supermarkets sell vegetables that are sourced from informal markets. The supermarket model and all their packaging make it seem safe, but I don't believe it. … I buy at the market from familiar vendors. They live around here and the whole neighbourhood buys from them. If their food would cause food poisoning or an accident, the whole neighbourhood would know that immediately.            (ID 362_R1)","When I buy pork at the market, I know whether the pig was slaughtered that same day; I can check the temperature of the meat. In the supermarket the pork meat is in the fridge, so I can't know whether the meat is fresh. I don't know the quality if I have not touched it. Fresh meat is softer and more elastic.            (ID362_R1)"
"I don't trust the safety claims of the supermarket. Market vendors do not dare to sell fake or unqualified foods, because people will return to the vendors and word of mouth will go quickly and they lose their business.            (ID258_R1)",To ensure our health and nutrition we need to eat a variation of dishes … I have to cook for every meal and try to finish all or keep leftover only until dinner. It's not healthy to eat food kept in the fridge.            (ID102_R1)
