,Proposition,Assessment,Emerging research questions
1,Mechanization increases unemployment,"Mixed evidence:            Mechanization may increase or decrease employment depending on several factors, including availability of land",Under which conditions does mechanization lead to rural unemployment? How can mechanization be used to create meaningful rural jobs?
2,Smallholder farmers cannot benefit from mechanization,False:            Smallholders can benefit if appropriate technologies are available and conducive institutions are in place,Which technological and institutional solutions are needed? What is the role of contractor models and how can they be supported? What is the potential of ICTs? What is the role for two-wheel tractors and animal traction?
3,"Mechanization is bad for the environment as it leads to expansion of cultivation, deforestation, monocultures, soil erosion and emissions","Mixed evidence            : While some negative effects have been observed, most effects can be avoided by using appropriate technologies and conducive agro-environmental policies",What type of mechanization (and associated agronomic practice) is best suited for which agro-ecological zones? What is the role of land-use planning? What are the options for the sustainable mechanization of different types of farming systems? What is the potential of renewable energy?
4,Mechanization benefits mostly men,"Mixed evidence            : While men have currently better access to mechanization, women can still benefit, depending on the intra-household distribution of labor",How can women's access to mechanization be ensured? What are the implications of mechanization on the intra-household allocation of time and income in different settings?
5,Financing mechanization is a challenge,"True:            Access to capital is an obstacle, but costs for machinery are declining with increased competition, and there are new models for financing mechanization",What is the potential of value chain finance involving three-way-solutions with banks and retailers/processors or manufacturers/dealers? Which policies are needed to support new models of financing machinery?
6,Governments need to import tractors because of market failures,"False:            State-led programs face major governance challenges. Where private markets do not evolve, public mechanization programs do typically not work either and where private markets do evolve, public programs may crowd out private companies",How to redirect the political will of governments from importing machinery towards creating a conducive environment for mechanization?
7,Governments have no role to play with regard to mechanization,"False            : Governments need to create an enabling environment, for example, regarding knowledge and skills development, import regulations and spare parts supply","How to create an enabling environment in the most cost-effective way? What is the role of the public, private and third sectors in this regard?"
8,Mechanization only saves labor and does not contribute to increased land productivity,Mixed evidence            : Mechanization can also have a positive effect on yields,Under which conditions and to what extent does mechanization enhance yields? What are the causal mechanisms (such as performing activities in the best time window)?
9,"Cooperatives are an easy way to share machinery and, thus, make it accessible to smallholders.","Mixed evidence            : Cooperatives face challenges related to collective action problems. However, they can help to organize access to services, credit and training","Under which conditions and for which types of machinery do solutions that are based on collective action (e.g., cooperatives, machine owner associations) work? What is the role of cooperatives in the creation of an enabling environment for mechanization?"
