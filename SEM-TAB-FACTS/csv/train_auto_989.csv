NE and DA co-release from LC terminals (Section                         2.1.4                        ),NE/DA co-release may mediate the action of atypical pharmacological agents (Section                         3.5.2                        )
Signatures of LC activity during cognition in humans (Section                         2.2.3                        ),Reduction of pupillometry and P3 signatures in SCZ during attention (Section                         3.3                        )
Role of LC in motivation to engage effort (Section                         2.2.3                        ),Reduction of pupillometry signatures with increased effort (Section                         3.3                        )
GANE model of NE-glutamate interplay explains arousal-mediated effect of salient events (Section                         2.1.3                        ),Altered function of molecules related to synaptic plasticity abnormally interact with neuromodulation in SCZ (Section                         3.2                        )
Network-reset and gain models of the effects of LC-NE system on switching and enhancement of brain networksâ€™ activity (Section                         2.2.2                        ),Lower signal-to-noise ratio of cortical circuits in SCZ (Section                         3.2                        )
Models of variability in LC recruitment and regulation of networks interaction explains traits such as working memory capacity (Section                         2.2.3                        ),Triple-network model and reduced working memory capacity in SCZ (Section                         3.3                        )
