,Visibility issue,Ethnographic participant observation,Interviews
Structural aspects,Project champions and championing intermediaries,- The identification of champions and intermediaries is ongoing; there is no certainty regarding who could be a championing intermediary,- Champions are salient and important figures in retrofit process narratives
,The energy retrofit market and ecology of intermediaries,"- The market, intermediaries and dynamics are directly observable with a fine and potentially cumbersome level of detail",- The market is embedded in past actions and focuses on key figures with a coarse level of detail
,Complexity,- Complexity is a constant issue that needs to be faced time and again,- Complexity is associated with specific events and has been contained and dealt with
Process aspects,The requirements of energy retrofit market entry and acquisition,- The difficulty and slowness of market entry is visible and open for detailed analysis,- Market entry and acquisition as a starting point of the overall process narrative; a low level of detail
,Alternative paths,"- Different retrofit options as equally interesting paths to pursue; re-directing, dead-ends and learning characterise the process",- The retrofit process as a singular path where different retrofit options have become ‘losing choices’
,What leads to successful outcomes,- Uncertainty over whether the taken actions will lead to a successful energy retrofit,- Projects are known to have been successful; the possibility to draw conclusions about common success factors (in principle)
