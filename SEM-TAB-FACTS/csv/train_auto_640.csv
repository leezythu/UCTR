Scenario                           a,Hazard,Source/Cause,Effect
The collision of ships with other ships/foundations or a sinking vessel,"The release of oil, fuel, and chemicals",Results during a collision or from maintenance & harvesting boats,"Potential uptake of hazard into seaweed. If this occurs, the seaweed is potentially unsafe and cannot be sold/used for food/feed"
The release of materials from substrates and equipment,Leaching of metals from coating material on foundations or ships and potential uptake of heavy metals by farmed seaweed                        Antifouling on foundations and maintenance ships/coating releases pesticides. The dissolving of used materials (pesticides) is taken up by farmed seaweed                           b,"Results when materials from substrates and/or equipment break off, detach or release","Potential uptake of hazard into seaweed. If this occurs, the seaweed is potentially unsafe and cannot be sold/used for food/feed"
Increased sea life/competition,"Injured and dead birds that cause potential contamination of seaweed due to bones, bacteria, fungi, and viruses",Results when birds collide with wind turbine rotor blades,"Potential uptake of hazard into the seaweed. If this occurs, the seaweed is potentially unsafe and cannot be sold/used for food/feed"
Integrated aquaculture,"The growth of new species, algae, fungi, and bacteria as well as toxins from these organisms",Results from modifications in platform installations to permit multi-use,"If this occurs, there is an increased possibility for unsafe substances, competition with sea life, and a shift in potential food/feed safety hazards; seaweed is potentially unsafe and cannot be sold/used for food/feed"
